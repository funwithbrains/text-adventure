## Class Generation

A class is generated as a part of the world.

A class can be global or regional.

A class can be learned:

* naturally
* through training
* through rituals
* through happenstance

### Mechanically

A class is a list of five passive abilities which can influence travel and combat in various ways.

Each class has five ranks. When you first acquire a class, you attain the first rank. For each rank, you get the one passive ability for that rank.

Classes can encourage you to use specific armaments, but they usually do not outright prevent you from wielding any armament you choose. (Some rare restrictive armaments may appear, but they are not currently planned.)

The most basic combat-related passive abilities will grant bonuses when wielding certain armament types or when using certain damage types.

Classes should not be balanced too perfectly. In fact, if a class's abilities are generated by an automated point-buy system, then each class should have a not-quite fair a curve for distributing these points across five levels of progression. each level should offer one passive ability.
